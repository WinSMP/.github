## Hello! 👋

Hello! This is WinSMP, a Minecraft server made by [walker84837](https://github.com/walker84837). Its focus is on modern, modular & independent, sleek, and first of all, open-source plugins. You can find its plugins in this organization's repos; they're mainly written in:
- Scala
- Kotlin
- Java

I also have weekly [Folia builds](https://github.com/WinSMP/BuildFoliaServer/releases).

### Contributing

You're *always* welcome to contribute, and I'm happy to review and accept new pull requests. Despite my time zone, you should receive a response quickly, as I check GitHub frequently. The contribution guidelines are the same for all repositories.

Additionally, the repositories are marked as [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com), so they will count towards the goal if you make a new PR.

All plugins should support Folia and Paper >=1.21.6. If you find an error related to Folia not being supported, please open a new issue and I will look over it.
